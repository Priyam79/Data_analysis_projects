# Power BI Analytics Projects


This repository showcases two end‑to‑end business analytics projects built with Excel, Power BI, and DAX. The first project analyses fitness‑tracker data from smart devices to understand user behaviour across sleep patterns, calories burned, and daily steps, using interactive dashboards to surface segments that can be targeted with tailored marketing strategies. The second project explores bike‑share data for a fictitious company, where Power BI reports break down usage by gender, age group, peak hours, and popular destinations to identify levers for increasing subscriptions and converting casual riders into annual members.
